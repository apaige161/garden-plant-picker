INSTRUCTIONS: download this repo and garden-plant-picker-rest-api
-npm install on both
-THEN
-npm start on garden-plant-picker-rest-api/rest-api
-ng serve on garden-plant-picker/my-garden

BUGS: 
  -user has to click refresh plants after adding a new garden to see it in the list of gardens and to see any gardens to filter from
  
  -error mess in console... "ERROR TypeError: Cannot read property 'forEach' of undefined
    at Main2Component.getEachGardenNameOnce"


RIGHT NOW: A user can choose a garden size, add new gardens with at least one plant in them, filter and sort saved gardens.

FUTURE: sign in, get produce yeilds, nice UI/UX

TODO: Primary

  --done- disable save button when there is no name 
  AND 
  --not done- do not allow saves of duplicate named gardens

  wrap list of plants(to choose from) to the next column 2-4 columns based on screen size
  
  create a better UI for displaying saved plants from the DB

  build the math to see how much an optimal garden will produce based on the plants inside
   
  split main2 into 2 separate components, move the saved gardens to another page?
   
   
  

UI: Secondary
   single page with a small button in the middle "Get Started" or something
   => animate into home page
   add an image for each veggie inside the popover

   
OTHER: Secondary
  add in potential yields for each crop
  add buttons with functions to calculate: total yield, per plant?, yield by plant, etc
