INSTRUCTIONS: download this repo and garden-plant-picker-rest-api
-npm install on both
-THEN
-npm start on garden-plant-picker-rest-api/rest-api
-ng serve on garden-plant-picker/my-garden

BUGS: 

  -user can still save a new garden with a already used name

  -user has to click refresh plants after adding a new garden to see it in the list of gardens and to see any gardens to filter from
  
  -error mess in console... "ERROR TypeError: Cannot read property 'forEach' of undefined
    at Main2Component.getEachGardenNameOnce"
    --may have to do with how things are loaded into the website (get all plants may be taking longer than it takes to start this function)
    --put that function on another lifecycle hook, ngOnAfterContentInit
    
   -if a user chooses not to fill up the entire row there is no way to go to the next row.
      --add a button to skip the current row and start adding to the next one
    


RIGHT NOW: A user can choose a garden size, add new gardens with at least one plant in them, filter and sort saved gardens.

FUTURE: sign in, get produce yeilds, nice UI/UX

VISION: 
   -single page with a small button in the middle "Get Started" or something
    => animate into home page
   
   -add an image for each veggie inside the popover

TODO: Primary

  -build the math to see how much an optimal garden will produce based on the plants inside
   
  -split main2 into separate components, move the saved gardens to another page!
  
  -canSave() method - loads in list of gardenNames, put (gardenNames) inside a ngOnChanges hook
    -re run this function based on the value change of (gardenName)
    -put gardenName inside ngOnChanges function
   
   -create login system on front and backend
  

UI: Primary

   TODO:
    -create a better UI for displaying saved plants from the DB
    -center plant list, flexbox??
    -update the main banner
    -create nav bar
    -create a home page
    -create login page
